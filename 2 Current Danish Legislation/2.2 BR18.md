# BR18
The 2023 amendment to BR18 introduced two new paragraphs to chapter 11. The first is § 297, which states that for any new building bound by the rules for energy frameworks covered in § 259 or § 260, a calculation of the building’s life cycle carbon footprint must be performed. This, essentially, applies to all heated buildings except for temporary, movable pavilions and vacation homes.
Any building bound by § 297 with a heated floor area larger than 1,000 m² must document a life cycle climate impact equal to or less than the limit value of 12.0 kg CO₂e/m²/yr.

## Requirements for the calculation
The life cycle carbon footprint calculation must be performed with a consideration period of 50 years and has to include life cycle modules colored blue in the table below. Note that module D is reported separately and does not count towards the limit value, hence why it is colored a lighter shade of blue. Module D is excluded from the carbon footprint calculation due to being considered a hypothetical benefit. There is currently no definitive way to predict whether materials will be reused or recycled at the conclusion of a project's lifecycle. Therefore, Module D accounts for potential future benefits from materials being utilized in subsequent projects after the building's demolition, which categorically places it outside the scope of the building assessment.
