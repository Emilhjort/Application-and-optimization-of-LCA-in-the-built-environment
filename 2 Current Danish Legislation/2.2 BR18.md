# BR18
The 2023 amendment to BR18 introduced two new paragraphs to chapter 11. The first is § 297, which states that for any new building bound by the rules for energy frameworks covered in § 259 or § 260, a calculation of the building’s life cycle carbon footprint must be performed. This, essentially, applies to all heated buildings except for temporary, movable pavilions and vacation homes.
Any building bound by § 297 with a heated floor area larger than 1,000 m² must document a life cycle climate impact equal to or less than the limit value of 12.0 kg CO₂e/m²/yr.

## Requirements for the calculation
The life cycle carbon footprint calculation must be performed with a consideration period of 50 years and has to include life cycle modules colored blue in the table below. Note that module D is reported separately and does not count towards the limit value, hence why it is colored a lighter shade of blue. Module D is excluded from the carbon footprint calculation due to being considered a hypothetical benefit. There is currently no definitive way to predict whether materials will be reused or recycled at the conclusion of a project's lifecycle. Therefore, Module D accounts for potential future benefits from materials being utilized in subsequent projects after the building's demolition, which categorically places it outside the scope of the building assessment.

## The building model
The carbon footprint of materials is calculated per m² of floor area with the following special modifications:
1.	All basement areas, refuse storage rooms at terrain level and air raid shelters are included.
2.	External ramps, stairs, balconies, and similar elements are included with 25% of their area.
3.	Integrated garages are included with 50% of their area.
4.	Integrated carports, sheds, coverings and similar are included with 25% of their area.
5.	Walk-on ceilings and similar are included with 25% of their area.
6.	Non-integrated garages and carports as well as sheds, greenhouses, covered terraces, utilized roof areas, and similar are not included.

Materials and building elements included in the life cycle carbon footprint calculation are described in BR18 Appendix 2, Table 6 – Building components for calculating climate impact, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.bygningsreglementet.dk/Bilag/B2/Bilag_2/Tabel_6#e53ebfa8-1dea-4737-aa53-69c8a848b30c) (only available in Danish). Some notable exclusions are permanent inventory (toilets, showers, ovens etc.) and all electrical and mechanical installations except solar panels and transportation devices (elevators, lifts, escalators).

Material carbon footprint is calculated either using the generic data basis described in BR18 Appendix 2, table 7 – Generic data basis, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.bygningsreglementet.dk/Bilag/B2/Bilag_2/Tabel_7#787e83a6-b7d9-4a83-a4be-37574156daef) (only available in Danish), or through Environmental Product Declarations (EPD). To use an EPD within the calculation, it must be representative of the material used in the building and must be valid at the date of being implemented into the building.

The BR18 generic data basis also describes a set of default values for technical installations within the building, which can be used as an alternative to save time, instead of calculating the carbon footprint of the specific materials and products used in the installation. The default values can be found in BR18 Appendix 2, table 7. The default values state a climate impact per m² of heated floor area plus heated basement area.

The service life of products and materials are stated in BUILD REPORT 2021:32, which can be found [here](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/publications/build-levetidstabel-version-2021) (only available in Danish). If the service life of a product or materials is shorter than the consideration period of 50 years, it is assumed to be replaced within the consideration period and, therefore, the climate impact of the replacement must also be included in the BR18 LCA as part of module B4. Module B4 is effectively the sum of climate impact of modules A1-3, C3, and C4 from the replacement product. The figure shows an example of how module B4 is calculated for a product with a service life of 20 years.

As of January 1st, 2024, the climate impact of directly reused building materials is considered to be 0 throughout the entire consideration period in a BR18 LCA. This also means that replacement is also considered to have a climate impact of 0 in the BR18 LCA when using reused materials. Directly reused materials must be included in the BR18 LCA, so it is visible that the materials have been used, but the climate impact is calculated as 0.

## Operational energy use
The energy framework calculation’s result is needed to calculate the climate impact of the building’s operational energy use (module B6).  To calculate the climate impact of module B6 in a BR18 LCA, the energy requirements from the energy framework calculation without primary energy factors must be used. Emission factors for operational energy use are described in BR18 Appendix 2, table 8 – Emission factors for electricity, district heating and gas, which can be found [here](https://www.bygningsreglementet.dk/bilag/b2/bilag_2/tabel_8/#c93d7bfe-6c32-4182-b858-cf113ba2a371) (only available in Danish). 

## Special building conditions
For some buildings, special conditions regarding the function of the building can lead to a significantly higher climate impact. For example, if the soil conditions are unfavorable, the foundations might need to be much bigger, leading to a higher climate impact than other buildings. In such cases the climate impact of the building is allowed to exceed the limit value by a certain amount. Details on how to calculate the acceptable exceedance can be found in BR18 Appendix 2, table 9 – Reference values for the calculation of climate impact, which are not included in the calculation according to § 298, paragraph 1, which can be found [here](https://www.bygningsreglementet.dk/bilag/b2/bilag_2/tabel_9/#514f3033-fd6d-4ff2-89eb-53a7752b8945) (only available in Danish).
