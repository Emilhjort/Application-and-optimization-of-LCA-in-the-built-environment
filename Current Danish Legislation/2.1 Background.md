# Background
In March, 2021 the Danish government came to an agreement on a national strategy for [sustainable construction](https://www.sbst.dk/byggeri/baeredygtigt-byggeri/national-strategi-for-baeredygtigt-byggeri). One part of this strategy relates to decreasing the global warming impact of the Danish construction sector. The first major step towards reaching this goal came in the form of an amendment to chapter 11 of the Danish building regulation (BR18), which introduced a requirement to document the carbon footprint of new buildings as well as limit values for larger buildings. [This amendment](https://www.sbst.dk/byggeri/baeredygtigt-byggeri/national-strategi-for-baeredygtigt-byggeri/klimakrav-lca-i-bygningsreglementet) entered into force on January 1st, 2023 , and was updated again one year later on January 1st, 2024.
